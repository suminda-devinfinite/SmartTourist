# SmartTourist
Travel Based Android App

The goal of the project is to explore how to realize a mobile tourist guide using the Android platform, including a prototype of the tourist guide application.
The project uses the waterfall model for Software development. Through designing and implementing an artifact (i.e. prototype of Tourist guide), the goal of the project is reached. Finally, the project is evaluated in four aspects including platform evaluation, general functional evaluation, scenario evaluation, and non-functional evaluation.
The prototype implemented includes basic functionalities of tourist guide such as showing a map, locating points of interest (POIs) on a map, locating location of a user, retrieving information of POIs, add reviews about POIs, plan a tour, support communication (e.g. phone, short message), show route direction to POIs, and choose different kinds of POIs to show on map.
Moreover, the project has explored how to integrate current technologies like Google Places, Google Map, Browser, Contact application and Phone application into the prototype.
As well, the project has investigated non-functional aspects including extendibility, tailorability, and usability.
Overall, the project presents a comprehensive understanding of how to realize Tourist guide on the new mobile platform Android.
